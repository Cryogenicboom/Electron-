Electron Movement

Only along Y-axis (up and down). X-position is mostly fixed (say x = 100px from left).

Movement controlled by UP and DOWN keys.

Obstacles (Atoms & Waves)

All obstacles spawn at the right side of the screen (x = 1280) and move left.

Speed increases gradually as the game progresses (maybe based on time survived or score).

Each obstacle can have unique behaviors:

Gold foil: deflects electron randomly

Electric wave: moves in a sine/cosine pattern vertically

Magnetic wave: slows electron movement temporarily

Heavy atoms (U, Pu): take longer to pass, test reflex

Optionally: chain obstacles for reflex tests (like you said: gold foil + atom right after).

Scoring

Simply time survived in seconds: score = current_time - start_time.

We can increase difficulty as score increases.

Collision Detection

If electron collides with an obstacle → game over.

Use pygame.Rect for collision simplicity.

Difficulty & Reflex Mechanics

Randomly spawn obstacles with patterns:

Gold foil → immediately followed by another atom/wave

Waves oscillate → electron must time movement

This will make the player constantly react rather than just dodge slowly.
